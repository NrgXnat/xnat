/**
 * The traceable grid-bag panel provides a way to view the grid lines defined by the various components injected into
 * the panel. This makes it easier to figure out which component may be causing layout issues in the panel display. To
 * view the grid lines, just create one of these objects with the constructor's trace parameter set to <b>true</b>.
 *
 * If you don't turn tracing on for the traceable grid-bag panel, then this code:
 *
 * <pre>final JPanel panel = new TraceableGridBagPanel(false);</pre>
 *
 * Is equivalent to this:
 *
 * <pre>final JPanel panel = new JPanel(new GridBagLayout());</pre>
 *
 * If you need to subsequently reference the <b>GridBagLayout</b> object directly, you can call the {@link #getLayout()}
 * method.
